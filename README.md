## 📌 About the Project
Owlnid is a **student lifestyle mental wellness companion app** designed for university students who feel alienated by traditional mental health apps.  

💡 Most existing solutions are:
- Too clinical 🧪  
- Boring & repetitive 😴  
- Irrelevant to campus life 🎓  

Owlnid bridges this gap with **gamification, social connection, and personalized wellness journeys**, creating a safe and engaging environment for students.
